# Contributing

## Code standards 
The code should follow the python pep8 standard. It should also be commented in such a way that other people can easily understand and continue to work on it 

*More information to be added later*

## How do I know what to add? 
Make sure to check our trello page and git-issues and try to take care of the functionality your CF-team is responsible for. 

## Version Control 
Please follow the git-guidelines

Especially 

* Never Push to Master directly, only push to your personal branch or the
Development branch when functionality is finished. 

* Be Careful when merging, don't destroy the work of someone else. 

* To make sure your code works with all the other work done in the project, pull changes from
the development branch as often as possible. 

* Write good commit messages that clearly describes what changes has been made. Also
remember to write them in English.

* Don’t push code that doesn’t work to any other branch than your own personal one. We
don’t want any code in development that makes other developers work crash

* Delete branches that you have created but don't use anymore
