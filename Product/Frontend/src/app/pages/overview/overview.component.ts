A user

  The percentage value shows the rate of success for each movie,
meaning how many times a movie has been watched when recommended.
The higher the percentage, the higher the success rate is for that specific movie.
This can be of interest since it shows whether a recommended movie has been a successful recommendation.`;

  Basically this graph shows what movies are trending the most.`;
