# **Coogl3**

This is our project we did in the course Software Engineering Theory TDDC88 at Link√∂ping University.
The project's core is to recommend movies to users, with emphasis on trending movies.
It does this through a machine learning algorithm and a trending algorithm that will get the
currently trending movies on youtube and twitter and then combine them to create a unique
user experience.
